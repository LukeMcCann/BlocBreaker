### Developer Tools / Review Tools

In this version review tools are left active to enable you to play through and experience each level. Please leave me a note if any levels appear to difficult.

There are 7 levels currently, to switch level press "1,2,3,4,5,6, or 7" atop the keyboard to see the respective level. 

### Game

A fast-paced anime-themed Arkanoid style block-buster!

The game offers a variety of levels, including "boss levels" in which the player can gain massive points by destroying a "Bloc-Art" image of popular anime characters.
